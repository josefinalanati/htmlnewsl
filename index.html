    The Minister of Health, General Eduardo Pazuello, reduced again, in a speech on Wednesday (10), the estimate of Covid-19 vaccine doses that are to be distributed to states and municipalities in March. This is the fifth reduction the ministry has announced this this month aloneâ€”the first was on the 2nd. According to Pazuello, the current estimate is for 22 and 25 million doses this month. On Monday (8), at an event in Rio de Janeiro, the minister cited an estimate of "between 25 and 28 million." The number is almost half of that announced on February 17 (46 million) and February 22 (48.9 million).
